       <h1>Java/Objective-C Bridge</h1>
       
       <p>This class library enables you to use any Objective-C library directly from Java without
           having to generate any Java class stubs.  It is built on top of the powerful JNA library,
           and interacts with Objective-C through the C functions in the Objective-C runtime.
       </p>
       
       <h2>Features</h2>
       
       <ol>
           <li><em>Access To All Native Libraries and Frameworks</em></li>
           <li><em>No need to generate class stubs</em></li>
           <li><em>Two-Way Communication</em> - Objective-C can use your Java objects
               just as your Java objects can use Objective-C objects.</li>
           <li>Annotations to mark Java methods that should be callable by Objective-C</li>
           <li>Very Thin Wrapper - so you don't have to learn a whole new way of working
               with Objective-C.</li>
       </ol>

       <h2>Getting Started</h2>
       
       <h3>Installation</h3>
       <ol>
           <li>Add the ObjCBridge.jar and jna.jar files into your class path</li>
           <li>Add libjcocoa.dylib to your java.library.path</li>
       </ol>
       
       <h3>The Basics</h3>
       
       <p>The Java Cocoa bridge can be used at three levels of abstraction:</p>
       <ol>
           <li><strong>Low level</strong> : Direct calling of Objective-C runtime functions.  E.g. objc_msgSend(), object_getClass(), etc...
               See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html">Apple's documentation
                   on the Objective-C runtime</a> for details of what these methods do.  You would use the {@link ca.weblite.Runtime Runtime.INSTANCE} singleton object
                   to access these functions through the Java Cocoa Bridge.
           </li>
           
           <li><strong>Mid level</strong> : Calling simplified procedural wrappers 
               around the Objective-C runtime functions via the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils RuntimeUtils} class and its
               set of static methods.
           </li>
           
           <li><strong>High level</strong> : Using the object-oriented API to interact with
               Objective-C objects and classes via Java wrapper objects.  This method makes
               use of the {@link ca.weblite.objc.Client Client}, {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxy}, 
               and {@link ca.weblite.objc.NSObject NSObject} classes primarily.
           </li>
       </ol>
               
       
       <h4>The Low-Level API</h4>
       
       <p>The low-level API is nothing more than a <a href="https://github.com/twall/jna">JNA</a> interface
           for the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html">Objective-C runtime functions</a>.
           If you are familiar with these functions, and you are comfortable calling them directly, then you are free to call this API directly.  
           In most cases, however, you will likely want to use a higher level API that handles a bit more of the plumbing.
       </p>
       
       <p>The following is a sample from the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeTest RuntimeTest} Unit test that makes use of this low-level API:</p>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/3974488.js?file=SampleLowLevelAPI.java"></script>
       
       <p>A few things to comment on here:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://twall.github.com/jna/3.5.1/javadoc/com/sun/jna/Pointer.html">{@code com.sun.jna.Pointer}</a> class is used throughout this API to represent
               a C pointer.
           </li>
           <li>Many of the low-level API functions take a Pointer as a parameter and return pointers, however the objc_msgSend() method
               and its variants return a long rather than a Pointer.  This is because the value returned by this method can be
               either a value or a pointer.
           </li>
           <li>
               Messages that take C strings (i.e. {@code const *char}) expect to receive a java string as a parameter.  Messages that
               take NSStrings, however, will not accept Strings of this type.  You need to provide a pointer to an NSString object
               in these cases.
           </li>
       </ol>
       
       <h4>The Mid-Level API</h4>
       
       <p>The mid-level API consists of a set of static convenience methods around commonly used functions of the Objective-C runtime API.
           These include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Getting Selectors</strong> using the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#sel RuntimeUtils.sel()} and {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#selName RuntimeUtils.selName()}
               methods.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Getting Classes</strong> using the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#cls RuntimeUtils.cls()} and {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#clsName RuntimeUtils.clsName()} 
                methods.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Sending Messages</strong> using one of the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#msg RuntimeUtils.msg()} variants.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <p>Even if your are working with the high-level API, you will still likely need to use the mid-level API in some instances.  For convenience, you may want to 
           use a static import of all of the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils RuntimeUtils} static methods so that you can access them quickly and easily:
       </p>
       <pre>{@code import static ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils.*;}</pre>
       
       <p>The following sample code is taken from one of the unit tests and gives a good example of how to use the mid-level API to interact with
           the Objective-C runtime:</p>
       
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/3974807.js?file=SampleMidLevelAPI.java"></script>
       
       <p>In order to provide a contrast with the low-level API, this example performs the same logic as the low-level
           example above. It makes use of the {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils#sel RuntimeUtils.sel()} function 
           to obtain a selector rather than longer Runtime.INSTANCE.sel_getUid().  It also uses the cls() and clsName() 
           functions to go back and forth between a class object and its class name.
       </p>
       <p>However, we can shorten this still more.  The {@code msg()} function includes a variant that accepts {@code String}s 
           as their first two arguments. If the first argument is a {@code String}, then it is assumed to be a class name. If
           the second argument is a {@code String}, then it is assumed to be a selector name.  Using this knowledge we can
           compress the above code significantly:
       </p>
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/3974863.js?file=SampleMidLevelAPI2.java"></script>
       
       
       <h5>Using Type-Mapping</h5>
       
       <p>The {@link ca.weblite.objc.RuntimeUtils RuntimeUtils} class also includes a few methods that act as a link and foundation
           to the higher level APIs.  It includes a variant of the {@code msg()} function that can optionally perform type mapping
           of input arguments and their return values.</p>
       <p>The method signature is as follows:</p>
       {@code Object msg(boolean coerceOutput,
                         boolean coerceInput,
                         Pointer receiver,
                         Pointer selector,
                         Object... args)}
                         
       <p>Note, that there are variants that allow you to specify the receiver or selector as strings also.</p>
       
       <p>If you pass {@code true} for both {@code coerceOutput} and {@code coerceInput}, then the method will
           perform type mapping on the input {@code args} and the return value so that you are able to pass
           more familiar Java objects in.  It will also perform type-checking to ensure that the correct
           variant of {@code objc_msgSend()} is sent to the Objective-C runtime (e.g. messages that return {@code float}s
           and {@code doubles} need to use the {@code objc_msgSend_fret()} function, and messages
           that return structures need to use the {@code objc_msgSend_sret()} function).</p>
       <p>The type mapping is minimal and non-complex. There are just a few key mappings that are performed by
       this method:</p>
       <ol>
           <li><strong>Converts Java {@code String} objects to Objective-C {@code NSString} objects</strong> for arguments
               that are passed to messages that are expecting {@code NSStrings}.  It uses the method signature
               of the method to determine if the transformation needs to be made.  I.e. if a Java {@code String}
               is passed as an argument to a message that is expecting an Objective-C object (i.e. type encoding "{@literal @}"),
               then the string will be converted to an {@code NSString} automatically.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Converts {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxy} objects into {@code Pointer} objects</strong> for arguments
                   that are expecting a Pointer or an Objective-C object.
           </li>
           <li>
               <strong>Automatically determines the correct variant of {@code objc_msgSend*}</strong> depending on the return type of 
               the message (as specified in the Objective-C message signature).
           </li>
           <li>
               <strong>Converts return {@code NSString} return values to Java {@code String} objects</strong>.
           </li>
           <li>
               <strong>Wraps {@code NSObject} return values in {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxy} objects</strong> so that
                   they can be used more easily.  It performs this conversion in a smart way using the {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy#load Proxy.load()}
                   method to make sure that there is ever only one instance of a Java proxy for each instance of an Objective-C
                   object.  I.e. If a {@code Proxy} object already exists for a particular Objective-C object, then this method
                   will look up the existing {@code Proxy} object and return that.  Otherwise it creates a new {@code Proxy} object
                   to wrap the return value and registers this proxy with the central proxy registry.
           </li>
           <li><strong>Messages that return Structures will return a subclass of 
                   <a target="_blank" href="http://twall.github.com/jna/3.5.1/javadoc/com/sun/jna/Structure.html">{@code com.sun.jna.Structure}</a></strong>
           </li>
       </ol>
       
       <p>The following is some sample code taken from one of the unit tests to demonstrate how this variant of {@code msg()} can
           be used to enable automatic type mapping in the return values of Objective-c messages.</p>
       
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/3975135.js?file=SampleMidLevelAPI3.java"></script>
       
       <h3>High-Level API (Object Oriented API)</h3>
       
       <p>Now that you see the foundation upon which the Java/Objective-C bridge sits, we can jump straight into the 
           higher-level object oriented API.  This API consists of three main classes that you'll wish to use.:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>{@link ca.weblite.objc.Client Client} - An object that allows you to send messages to the Objective-C runtime.  You'll generally 
               use this to instantiate new Objective-C objects and obtain {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxies} to them.
           </li>
           
           <li>{@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxy} - A wrapper around an Objective-C object that enables you to easily send messages
               to the native object.  It includes convenience methods for sending messages that return various types.  E.g. the {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy#sendInt sentInt()} 
               method sends a message to which you expect an {@code int} to be returned.  It returns a Java {@code int} so that 
               you don't need to perform any ugly type casting.
           </li>
           
           <li>{@link ca.weblite.objc.NSObject NSObject} - A Java wrapper around an Objective-C object that enables two-way communication.  Objective-C
               can call methods on this Java class, and you are able to send messages to the object's native Peer from Java.  This is a subclass
               of {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy Proxy} so that it includes all of the same capabilities for sending messages.  Typically you would subclass
               {@link ca.weblite.objc.NSObject NSObject} if you need to create a delegate for an objective-C object.  You can define Java methods 
               in your subclass that can be used in Objective-C via the {@link ca.weblite.objc.annotations.Msg Msg} annotation.
           </li>
       </ol>
       
       <p>The following snippet is taken from a unit test.  It shows the use of the {@link ca.weblite.objc.Client Client} class and {@link ca.weblite.objc.Proxy}
           class to create an NSMutable array and add some strings to it.</p>
       
       <script src="https://gist.github.com/3975339.js?file=SampleHighLevelAPI.java"></script>
       
       <h3>Writing a Delegate Class In Java</h3>
       
       <p>The {@link ca.weblite.objc.NSObject NSObject} class can be extended to define your own Java classes that can be called from Objective-C.
           You specify which methods can handle Objective-C messages using the {@link ca.weblite.objc.annotations.Msg Msg} annotation.  There
           is an example at the top of the page that uses this method to add a delegate to the {@code NSOpenPanel} dialog.
